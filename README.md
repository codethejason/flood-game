# Flood Game using ReasonReact

Flood game created in reason react. To develop, run commands in separate terminals:
```
npm install
npm run server
npm run start
npm run test
```

Specify board size and flood all of the tiles with the same color by clicking on tiles on the board. Inspiration from [here](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles/js/flood.html).
